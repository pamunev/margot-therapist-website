    return (
        <div>
            <p>
                Here I think I want to have a contact form, with a text box where someone can write a message, and then send it, and it sends the message to Margot's email. I'll find out how to do that.
            </p>
            <p>
                To reach me, you can email me at <a href="mailto:margotgoralczyk@gmail.com">margotgoralczyk@gmail.com</a> or call me at XXX-XXX-XXXX.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can also send me a message through this form:
            </p>
        </div>
                
    )
}

export default Contact
