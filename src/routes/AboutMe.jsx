            Margot is a Licensed Master of Science of Social Work from the University of Texas at Austin. She has a history of almost 10 years of working with the older adult population in a wide array of settings and positions. Her undergraduate degree is in Rehabilitation Science with a concentration in Gerontology. After completing graduate school, she worked as a Psychiatric Social Worker at Austin State Hospital. Margot went on to work with individuals in the death and dying process, providing grief support to their loved ones and caregivers. In her last position, she worked with adolescents and adults as a therapist in an outpatient therapy setting where she provided intensive individual, family, and group therapy. Margot enjoys hiking the Greenbelt, taking her rescue and emotional support dog, Poppy (who accompanies her to work at AMC) on adventures around town, practicing yoga, reading/listening to audiobooks, drawing, running around Town Lake, and eating tacos (Tysonâ€™s is one of her favorite taco places).
